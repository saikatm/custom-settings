To remove the user name (like on the image above) 
	set DEFAULT_USER  in  ~/.zshrc . 
	The line is probably not there so you should just add it like this  DEFAULT_USER=yourusername



Set Babun home directory to Windows user home directory


You might want to set the home directory to your current windows user. This can be done via these simple steps.

Close Babun
Create an environment variable for HOME = C:/Users/my_account_name
Press the windows key and type env
Open ‘Edit envirnoment variables for your account’
Create a new variable with HOME as variable name and C:/Users/my_account_name as variable value
Open Babun and run  babun install
Restart Babun
If you experience some issues with zsh after this try running these commands


compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
cp ~/.zcompdump{,-$HOSTNAME-$ZSH_VERSION}
